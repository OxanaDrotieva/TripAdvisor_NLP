       "      <td>EATALY is another ny institution. It is the sum of mario batali and joe &amp; lidia bastianich. Eataly is a huuuuuuuuuuugeeee italian indoor open-air market restaurant. You can buy kitchen products, fresh produce, meats, fish, cheese, desserts, gelato, italian goodies, coffee AND eat at one of the numerous mini-restaurants. Note, these restaurants are part of the market so you will be in the midst of commotion most of the time. Each restaurant has a theme and you cannot order food from another. You are stuck. I haven’t had the cheese/wine/meat in the standing room only area, but I wish to one of these days. Usually the group is too tired to want to actually stand for an hour. Il Pesce is the fresh seafood restaurant. Delicious fresh fish!! But I hate hate that it is in an open and bustling area, where non-eating guests are watching and hovering in the vicinity. The fish is so fresh and delicious that I’m willing to deal with the chaos for that hour. Totally worth visiting to try the fish &amp; see Eataly for what it is. La Pizza &amp; Pasta is, simply put, just ordinary. Paccheri Al Suto Di Mare [huge tubular seafood pasta]. Cooked al-dente=great. The flavors of the pasta, however, were underwhelming. Note that in Italia the noodles are the most important part while flavors play a second fiddle. Salsicciotta Pizza [smoked provola cheese, mushrooms, neapolitan sausage]. It was disappointing; nothing left an impression in my mouth. I first visited the year it opened in 2010. It was way too crowded and I vowed never to come back. But I’ve been 2x since. And now it is literally across the park from my work. How can I resist a cappuccino or espresso? I’ll be here, hopefully, when the crowds are not.</td>\n",

Of course the cuban sandwich is outstanding, its filled with juicy roast pork, ham, swiss cheese in the soft crunchy bread that makes you want to eat the bread for days!! I’ve tried other dishes, but these two are the ones worth coming back for. I miss this place when I’m away, and when I’m here I am willing to sit in an non-air conditioned resto [during 110F heat waves]. The joint is small, uncomfortable to sit in, and has some of the worst service ever, but that will never stop me from the corn I so love~</td>\n",

       "119455  EATALY is another ny institution. It is the sum of mario batali and joe & lidia bastianich. Eataly is a huuuuuuuuuuugeeee italian indoor open-air market restaurant. You can buy kitchen products, fresh produce, meats, fish, cheese, desserts, gelato, italian goodies, coffee AND eat at one of the numerous mini-restaurants. Note, these restaurants are part of the market so you will be in the midst of commotion most of the time. Each restaurant has a theme and you cannot order food from another. You are stuck. I haven’t had the cheese/wine/meat in the standing room only area, but I wish to one of these days. Usually the group is too tired to want to actually stand for an hour. Il Pesce is the fresh seafood restaurant. Delicious fresh fish!! But I hate hate that it is in an open and bustling area, where non-eating guests are watching and hovering in the vicinity. The fish is so fresh and delicious that I’m willing to deal with the chaos for that hour. Totally worth visiting to try the fish & see Eataly for what it is. La Pizza & Pasta is, simply put, just ordinary. Paccheri Al Suto Di Mare [huge tubular seafood pasta]. Cooked al-dente=great. The flavors of the pasta, however, were underwhelming. Note that in Italia the noodles are the most important part while flavors play a second fiddle. Salsicciotta Pizza [smoked provola cheese, mushrooms, neapolitan sausage]. It was disappointing; nothing left an impression in my mouth. I first visited the year it opened in 2010. It was way too crowded and I vowed never to come back. But I’ve been 2x since. And now it is literally across the park from my work. How can I resist a cappuccino or espresso? I’ll be here, hopefully, when the crowds are not.   \n",

It is an anomaly that the place is “cuban” but they’re serving “mexican” corn. No qualms here, its even better than the kind they sell at the OC fair~ It is delicious, but sometimes can come out slightly overcooked. Regardless, its still delish. Of course the cuban sandwich is outstanding, its filled with juicy roast pork, ham, swiss cheese in the soft crunchy bread that makes you want to eat the bread for days!! I’ve tried other dishes, but these two are the ones worth coming back for. I miss this place when I’m away, and when I’m here I am willing to sit in an non-air conditioned resto [during 110F heat waves]. The joint is small, uncomfortable to sit in, and has some of the worst service ever, but that will never stop me from the corn I so love~   \n",

The only reason I frequent other Korean restaurants in the area is purely because nothing else is open or my people want it. and no, the korean food in flushing is still expensive and doesn’t compare to LA. oh LA i miss all your delicious and cheap korean eats! I love that they provide delicious side dishes. And they have house-made tofu and biji!! I LOVE IT. you can order anything and it’ll taste right. If there comes a day when anyone wants to eat this place, I will NEVER say no… I will even go alone because its worth it. :]   \n",

Sometimes it takes great. Other times it is underwhelming. Just not consistent in terms of food quality or service. I’ve had the okonomiyaki, takoyaki, multiple skewers, grilled teriyaki squid, buta kimchi itame, miso eggplant, shrimp shumai, fried shrimp, fried chicken gizzards, etc… They are overall decent, not amazing. Perhaps Yakitori Taisho (on St. Marks in East Village) is just cheaper, better and more fun. I think Hagi definitely caters to the midtown after work crowd, so they probably don’t have to try as hard to keep their service or food at a certain level since St. Marks isn’t around the corner to get better things… Overall, it is a decent izakaya and a small haven from the rest of midtown so if you decide to join, make sure you head downstairs, otherwise you are at a random different restaurant…!   \n",

What you want after a 3 hour Broadway play is to relax and chill out having a late night dinner with wine. Wolfgang's doesn't care about that, they just want to charge you 200 dollars for a uninspired steak and dry shrimps.  They sell just the name rather than having appetising food.</td>\n",

If you re gonna put tables where the customers feel erased and suppressed from the scene, don't put that table for the extra dollars. This is what happens with friends recommendations, not by my own research.  Strange place, the glasses of wine were poorly served. Again, a non tasty red wine. Lots of avocado. Avocado is not meant to eat in that quantities.  Located in a strategic place where attracts the tourists from the Whitney Museum.  Two blocks away there are fabulous restaurants in West Village, like the Pizzeria Brunetti, it's very near and much better. One of the best pizzas in New York.  Santina doesn't give a good name to Torrisi or Carbone. Zingara tu madre.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cosme is the high end restaurant from acclaimed Mexican chef Enrique Olvera. Pujol is in the world's 50 best restaurants. Im Mexican and been to Pujol several times. I tried since their opening to get a table at Cosme and they were always full, it was the first 6 months hype. Now I got a table a few hours before.  The Uni Tostada was really hard to chew. The octopus wasn't good at all.  I felt the food generic, raw fish with citrus sauce. The wine was spectacular, a Pinot Noir from Oregon. The best was the merengue dessert. The waiters were pretentious, with big egos, cold and their looks didn't help to the atmosphere. The hostess was out of place.  I'm not excited with Cosme, I felt it hollow. Not really sure what the hype is all about. Lots of empty tables. Classic New York.  The food has no depth and was tame, the space is generic. Pricey.</td>\n",

If by mistake you end having lunch in a dinner place it can be depressing. That's what happened to us in Uncle Jack's. You don't know if the Phantom of the Opera or Large from the Addams Family will host the evening.  It was decadent and dirty. It was empty. We should walk out, but we were starving.  Nothing else to remember, the food was plain.   \n",

Mediocre food.  The service was rushed, they wanted us to eat in 5 minutes. It was late, and post theater. What you want after a 3 hour Broadway play is to relax and chill out having a late night dinner with wine. Wolfgang's doesn't care about that, they just want to charge you 200 dollars for a uninspired steak and dry shrimps.  They sell just the name rather than having appetising food.   \n",

If you re gonna put tables where the customers feel erased and suppressed from the scene, don't put that table for the extra dollars. This is what happens with friends recommendations, not by my own research.  Strange place, the glasses of wine were poorly served. Again, a non tasty red wine. Lots of avocado. Avocado is not meant to eat in that quantities.  Located in a strategic place where attracts the tourists from the Whitney Museum.  Two blocks away there are fabulous restaurants in West Village, like the Pizzeria Brunetti, it's very near and much better. One of the best pizzas in New York.  Santina doesn't give a good name to Torrisi or Carbone. Zingara tu madre.   \n",
       "467479  Cosme is the high end restaurant from acclaimed Mexican chef Enrique Olvera. Pujol is in the world's 50 best restaurants. Im Mexican and been to Pujol several times. I tried since their opening to get a table at Cosme and they were always full, it was the first 6 months hype. Now I got a table a few hours before.  The Uni Tostada was really hard to chew. The octopus wasn't good at all.  I felt the food generic, raw fish with citrus sauce. The wine was spectacular, a Pinot Noir from Oregon. The best was the merengue dessert. The waiters were pretentious, with big egos, cold and their looks didn't help to the atmosphere. The hostess was out of place.  I'm not excited with Cosme, I felt it hollow. Not really sure what the hype is all about. Lots of empty tables. Classic New York.  The food has no depth and was tame, the space is generic. Pricey.   \n",
