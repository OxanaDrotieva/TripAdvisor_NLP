       "119455  eataly is another ny institution. it is the sum of mario batali and joe & lidia bastianich. eataly is a huuuuuuuuuuugeeee italian indoor open-air market restaurant. you can buy kitchen products, fresh produce, meats, fish, cheese, desserts, gelato, italian goodies, coffee and eat at one of the numerous mini-restaurants. note, these restaurants are part of the market so you will be in the midst of commotion most of the time. each restaurant has a theme and you cannot order food from another. you are stuck. i haven’t had the cheese/wine/meat in the standing room only area, but i wish to one of these days. usually the group is too tired to want to actually stand for an hour. il pesce is the fresh seafood restaurant. delicious fresh fish!! but i hate hate that it is in an open and bustling area, where non-eating guests are watching and hovering in the vicinity. the fish is so fresh and delicious that i’m willing to deal with the chaos for that hour. totally worth visiting to try the fish & see eataly for what it is. la pizza & pasta is, simply put, just ordinary. paccheri al suto di mare [huge tubular seafood pasta]. cooked al-dente=great. the flavors of the pasta, however, were underwhelming. note that in italia the noodles are the most important part while flavors play a second fiddle. salsicciotta pizza [smoked provola cheese, mushrooms, neapolitan sausage]. it was disappointing; nothing left an impression in my mouth. i first visited the year it opened in 2010. it was way too crowded and i vowed never to come back. but i’ve been 2x since. and now it is literally across the park from my work. how can i resist a cappuccino or espresso? i’ll be here, hopefully, when the crowds are not.   \n",
